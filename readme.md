# SecureFace
SecureFace is a project developed for UIDAI, an organization under the Indian government that provides unique identification to residents of India. It demonstrates a method for deploying machine learning models for real-time face authentication within web browsers, focusing on security.

Its a secure solution for browser-based ML applications where models are transmitted and executed on the client side. Its architecture can be extended to other applications requiring secure communication between the server and client.

## Project Structure and How to Get Started

### Backend/MERN API
Handles fetching models from S3, encryption using DHKE, serving the models to clients and the database(CIDR) operations.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Navigate to the `mern-api` directory:
```bash 
cd backend/mern-api
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Configure the environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required details.
4. Start the server:
```bash
node app.js
```

### Backend/Flask API
Handles face verification (i.e., verifying the user's face against the database).  

**Steps to Run:**
1. Configure the environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required details.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the server:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Frontend

**Steps to Run:**
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Cloud Configurations

### S3 Setup
1. Configure an S3 storage bucket.
2. Enable KMS encryption on the bucket.
3. Obtain the following keys and details:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `KMS_KEY_ID`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`

### GitHub CI/CD
1. Update the `backend/model_versions.json` file to trigger a new deployment.
2. Place the updated models in the `backend/s3-uploads` folder.
3. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically upload the models to S3.

Now the project is ready to run!

## Techniques Used to Maintain Security üîí

1. **KMS Encryption**:  
   Enabled at AWS S3 to secure stored models.  
2. **DHKE with RSA Encryption**:  
   Used for secure model transfer between the client and server.  
3. **Digital Signature Verification**:  
   Ensures tamper detection at the client side.  
4. **Script Obfuscation**:  
   Prevents reverse engineering and knowledge of model usage.
